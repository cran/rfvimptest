Description: Sequential permutation testing for statistical
  significance of predictors in random forests and other prediction methods. 
  The main function of the package is rfvimptest(), which allows to test for 
  the   statistical significance of predictors in random forests using 
  different (sequential) permutation test strategies [1]. The advantage 
  of sequential over conventional permutation tests is that they
  are computationally considerably less intensive, as the sequential
  procedure is stopped as soon as there is sufficient evidence
  for either the null or the alternative hypothesis.
